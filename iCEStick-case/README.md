# iCE stick case
This is a simple laser cuttable case for the iCE stick FPGA board. This is prepared on three layers. This can be prepared in cast acrylic for a crystal-clear view of the innards.

The interal layer is intended for 4mm thick material, with the top and bottom sheets can be thinner, perhaps 3mm.
